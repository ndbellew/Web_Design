### What is the web.

__Client and Server__
> First the client submits an http request (https) which is considered "Typset", the server has some webserver, which responds with the various responses, css, htmp, whatever is requested.


*Client*
 **Typset**
    > The typeset can be some application that is sent to the client, many are javascript applications.
    SPA - in order to make multi-paged/single paged apps feel multi-paged regardless of what they are, this improves speed and efficiency.
      - just send pre-loaded packages that are easier to load in single pages rather than a new page.
      - a way to think of this would be to have a base main page with other pages hidden and the pages become visible depending on what the user is requesting.

*Server*
 **Site**
    > the site contains multiple pages of applications that contains some kind of templating-engine that is compiled into a large javascript application which is sent to the client upon request.
 **Snowflake**
    > When you create a server that can never be reproduced, which is a problem because if it fails, ever, you pretty much need to restart.
